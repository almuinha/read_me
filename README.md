# Caroline Almuinha
<sub>*Data Engineer at Iteris Consultoria e Software*</sub>

I work as a Data Engineer at Iteris Consultoria e Software with skill in the cloud tools Azure Databricks (Apache Spark) and Data Factory, GCP tools (BigQuery, Dataprep, Composer, Cloud Run, Cloud Scheduler).

I worked for six years as a DBA, evolving from Junior to Senior level, dealing with SQL Server, Oracle and MySQL (and soon PostgreSQL) platforms, as well as Windows and Linux operating systems.

I climbed the IT ladder starting my work in the area as a Support Assistant, moving to Developer after studying Systems Analysis and Development, and reaching the much desired opportunity as a DBA after completing a postgraduate degree in Database Administration.
Now as a Data Engineer, completing the second postgraduate degree in Data Science and Big Data.

**Background in:** Machine Learning, Python, Powershell.
